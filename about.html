          It was in Mid-autumn 2002 that City University started with fifteen
          students, two departments, meager resources, and a group of dedicated
          and dynamic teachers. 16 years since 2002, we have now Eight thousand
          brilliant students, six computer laboratories, two mechanical workshop
          and laboratories, one digital laboratory, physics and chemistry
          laboratories, an extensive textile laboratory, ten booming departments
          (with two other departments in the process of being organized),
          well-trained teachers, a spirited team of support staff, and a
          dedicated management group. What started as an experimental project
          has now been transformed into a prestigious educational institute with
          a wide range of well educated, both local and global.
